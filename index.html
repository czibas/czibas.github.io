            Hi! My name is Camille Zibas and I am a junior at the University of North Alabama. Origninally, I was
            a premedical student, but decided to change my major to bio-technical engineering my sophmore year.
            After I earn my degree, I hope to design and make equipment for doctors and surgeons to perform less 
            invasive surgeries.

            I was born and raised in Huntsville, Alabama, where my parents and two younger sisters still live. 
            While growing up in Huntsville, I was on a competetive swim team for almost 14 years, until I was told
            I would no longer be able to swim due to a shoulder/back injury. This was a big motivator for the 
            degree I am persuing. 
        </p>

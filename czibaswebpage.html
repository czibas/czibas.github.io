        <p>
            Hi! My name is Camille Zibas and I am a junior at the University of North Alabama. Origninally, I was
            a premedical student, but decided to change my major to bio-technical engineering my sophmore year.
            After I earn my degree, I hope to design and make equipment for doctors and surgeons to perform less 
            invasive surgeries.

        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>
        
            I was born and raised in Huntsville, Alabama, where my parents and two younger sisters still live. 
            While growing up in Huntsville, I was on a competetive swim team for almost 14 years, until I was told
            I would no longer be able to swim due to a shoulder/back injury. This was a big motivator for the 
            degree I am persuing.

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
            My family is a big part of my life. My mom and little sister are truly my favorite people. 
            I talk to them both everyday. I am also very close with dad and middle sister, Julia.
            One reason I chose UNA was because it is close to my family and we are able to
            see each other often.
        </p>

        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>
            One thing my family and I love to do together is travel. We have been 
            fortunate enough to go to many beaches over the years, as well as the Grand 
            Canyon, Costa Rica, and Rome, Italy. All of these trips were very special and I can't wait to travel more with my family.
        </p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
            My parents taught me and my younger sisters that having a good work ethic is 
            one of the most important things to have. I got my first job at 15, and have 
            working ever since. My longest employment was at the Huntsville Aquatic Center,
            where i worked as a lifeguard for 4 years, and continue to work when in Huntsville.
            I currently work at a boutique in Tuscumbia called Nellie Mae. While I haven't worked
            there long, I enjoy the job and love the boutique!
